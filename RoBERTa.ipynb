            "['Online retailer understood to have tested service from east London depot and asked suppliers to begin deliveries within weeks Amazon is believed to be planning to start delivering fresh food in the UK this month, stepping up the pressure on traditional supermarkets. The online retailer is understood to have been testing fresh food deliveries from its depot in east London and to have asked suppliers to begin deliveries in the next few weeks. One supplier of chilled meals, Bol, told trade magazine the Grocer that its salad bowls would be launching on Amazon Fresh on 18 May. Amazon is expected to ramp up its food business after appointing Doug Gurr, the boss of its Chinese business and a former Asda executive, to run its UK operations. Gurr takes over this month from Chris North, who has quit the company. Gurr has extensive experience of running online food businesses. In his four and a half years at Asda, he was responsible for strategy, logistics and online operations. The arrival of Amazon Fresh, which has been operating in the US for about seven years, comes after the online business signed a deal with British supermarket Morrisons. The Bradford-based chain has agreed to wholesale ambient, fresh and frozen products to Amazon despite already operating its own website in partnership with Ocado. Last September Amazon began selling frozen items via its Prime Now one-hour delivery service, which is offered in big cities including London and Manchester. That followed the expansion of the Amazon Pantry service, which enables shoppers to fill a box of grocery items from a range of 4,000 household products, including big brands such as Kellogg’s, Ariel, Colgate and Kronenbourg. Fresh and frozen food is not sold via Pantry. Amazon’s latest move comes as Sainsbury’s finalises its tie-up with Argos, the multi-channel retailer – a move seen as a way to fight off future competition from the online retailer. Analysts are hoping the supermarket will reveal more about its plans for the the £1.4bn takeover alongside its annual results on Wednesday. Sainsbury’s has already stepped up its online activity since Mike Coupe took over as chief executive in July 2014. On Tuesday, the company said it planned to double the number of stores where shoppers could collect groceries ordered online from a “drive-through” site in the car park. The supermarket launched its click-and-collect groceries service in March 2015 and plans to have 200 sites in a year’s time, up from 100 at present. Robbie Feather, Sainsbury’s director of online, said: “Click and collect is proving to be a popular hybrid between online shopping and visiting a store, especially among shoppers juggling work and looking after young children.” Sainsbury’s is also hiring 150 more digital and technology experts to help improve its online store. The supermarket had already more than doubled its digital and technology staff in the past year, hiring 480 workers as it fends off rising competition from Amazon as well as the UK’s dominant online grocer Tesco.', 'Corporation in talks with potential partners including ITV and NBC Universal about new subscription service BBC plans to launch a homegrown rival to Netflix and Amazon Prime are a step closer to reality after the government gave it the green light to launch a new paid-for subscription service. Corporation chiefs have held talks with potential partners including ITV and NBC Universal, owner of the producer of shows including Downton Abbey, about launching a new subscription streaming service, as revealed by the Guardian in March. Early indications are that it would charge viewers to watch BBC programmes after the 30-day window in which they are currently available to watch for free on the iPlayer has expired. It may also include some original content – the BBC already premieres a small selection of comedies, drama and documentaries on the iPlayer – but the bulk of the material would already have been shown on the BBC. Talks with commercial partners suggest its scope would go beyond BBC programmes, however, creating a UK-based global rival to take on House of Cards broadcaster Netflix and Amazon Prime, which will air The Grand Tour, the new motoring show with former Top Gear presenters Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond, later this year. Currently, viewers who want to watch a BBC programme beyond the iPlayer window can choose to download it from the recently launched BBC Store. Older BBC content can be accessed on a variety of other platforms including DVDs and pay-TV service UKTV, as well as Amazon Prime and Netflix, which has the rights to shows such as Top Gear. Last week’s government white paper on the future of the BBC said it “welcomes the BBC’s commitment to develop and test some form of additional subscription services”. It said it would be up to the BBC to “set to the scope of these plans” but the government said it was “clear that this would be for additional services only”. “Licence fee payers will not be asked to pay for ‘top-up’ services for anything they currently get,” it added. Culture secretary John Whittingdale told the Telegraph: “We’re moving into a different world where more and more content is going to be made available on demand. Collaboration with other broadcasters and other production companies we think is important. If they want to explore that kind of thing, we’d encourage them. “There may come a moment in the future where all television is delivered online, and if you do that it becomes a more realistic practical possibility if you wanted to move towards an element of voluntary subscription, which is why the BBC, who see the way the world is changing, have said: ‘Yeah we will just see for the online provision, whether or not there might be a case for additional new content being delivered on a subscription service, via the iPlayer.’ “That’s something they’re going to look at. It was their suggestion, and they have said they will draw up the scope of the trial.” The BBC has traditionally been wary of introducing subscription services in the UK, which many would regard as signalling the death knell of the £145.50 licence fee, and any new service would have to pass a number of regulatory hurdles. BBC strategy chief James Purnell said two years ago that any move to introduce “subscription payments for its services would lead to ‘first and second class’ licence fee payers and cost £500m to implement”. The BBC white paper also signalled that the government would act to close the £150m iPlayer “loophole” where people can currently watch BBC content for free on-demand if they do not have a TV.', 'The e-commerce giant saw a 28% rise in sales on same point last year, and 64% sales boost for Amazon Web Services, but costs remain a key factor for its future Amazon.com traditionally has only faced one obstacle in its quest to infiltrate every aspect of consumers’ lives: it often lost money. For a straight year now, that’s no longer the case. On Thursday Jeff Bezos’ digital commerce empire reported better-than-expected profits, sending its share price up some 12% during after hours trading. The company reported a $513m profit during the first three months of 2016, up dramatically from its $57m loss during the same stretch last year. That makes it Amazon’s most profitable quarter ever and its fourth straight. The company sold $29.1bn worth of goods and services, up 28% from a year ago. The company’s spending, including the billions it spends on shipping, rose by a similar amount. Costs are a key factor for Amazon’s future. It is currently wrestling with building its own shipping service to compete with the likes of UPS. On a conference call Thursday with financial analysts, chief financial officer Brian Olsavsky said, “we’re actually going to go ahead and buy some trailers”. He then noted the company recently agreed to lease up to 20 Boeing 767 jets. Amazon does not disclose how much money it makes from consumer gadgets, such as the Kindle reader or its Echo “smart speaker”. In a press release, Bezos is quoted as saying his firm sold twice as many Fire tablets as during the first quarter last year. Of Echo, he said it “too is off to an incredible start, and we can’t yet manage to keep it in stock despite all efforts”. The company did however offer details on how much it brings in from something much more pedestrian, and profitable. Sales for Amazon Web Services, which hosts websites, rose nearly 64% against the same period last year to $2.6 billion. The good news for Amazon here is that running a bunch of servers for others’ websites costs a lot less than shipping goods across the globe. Olsavsky faced questions from one analyst Thursday about how the company can continue to grow some of its popular services, such as Prime, which offers expedited shipping and more streaming programming for an upfront $99 annual fee. The service may be a hit with university students and affluent, but may seem daunting for lower income families. Olsavsky said the company is considering offering a monthly option that would entice more people to try Prime. “It is a hurdle for many people,” he said. Of course profits could be a double-edged sword for Amazon. For years, Amazon avoided large tax bills as the company plowed so much money into its operation that it ran at a loss.Now, in theory, it will have to pay more taxes to governments for staying out of the red.  ', 'Top-end e-reader is a cut above the rest, rethinking the Kindle design and experience, cutting 20% weight and costing a pretty penny in the process Amazon’s latest high-end Kindle breaks with the mould of the basic e-reading experience to become a luxury item in a class of its own.  The new Oasis – Amazon’s biggest step forward towards its goal to creation paper 2.0 – is a whole new entry in the Kindle range. It takes technology from the others, refined and placed into a thinner, lighter and rethought design.  The Oasis has no new standout features. It runs the same version of the Kindle software. It loads ebooks, magazines and newspapers from Amazon’s store or side-loaded from a computer on an E-ink screen. It has the same screen technology as the £110 Kindle Paperwhite, just with 60% more LEDs lining the display’s side for a brighter, slightly more even frontlight. The screen is excellent, with text looking sharp and clear and easily readable in all conditions. With the backlight on around level 15 the text appears to almost float out from the screen, with the matt black bezel disappearing from view. Instead, the Oasis is all about making the e-reader get out of the way of the ebook-reading experience. The device itself is 20% lighter than previous Kindles. The design has been rethought; it is no longer symmetrical, with one side thicker and wider than the other and page-turn buttons that stick out of the front. The asymmetric design means that the majority of the weight of the Kindle - all 131g of it – is distributed closer to your hand making it easier to grip and hold steady. It’s a subtle difference, but is a big improvement when reading for long periods meaning your hand doesn’t get as tired and is easier to hold and read than a paperback. The body also feels a lot more sturdy and durable. It’s made of electroplated plastic, which makes it light but strong, while the glass and display has been toughened against impact, meaning it should survive being tossed into a bag without issue. Included in the box is also a protective cover that attaches magnetically to the back of the Oasis. It adds weight, but also battery life to the e-reader (more on that later). With the cover attached the Oasis becomes a more uniform thickness and weight distribution. The flap attaches to the back of the Kindle magnetically when reading, exposing the soft felt lining. It provides quite a nice grip surface. It’s not quite as nice and balanced as without the battery cover, but is still nicer to hold than previous Kindles thanks to the larger bezel one side of the screen which makes for a larger area to hold it. The e-reader is only one part of the Oasis. The other is a battery and protective cover, which come in the box and attaches magnetically to the back slotting into the tapered edge. Without the battery cover the Oasis has a rated life of seven hours reading. With the battery attached it will last for 28 hours between charges, which take three hours via microUSB. The battery case charges the internal battery of the Kindle too, at a rate of 1 hour of reading per 10 minutes attached to the case. During my testing, with data connectivity on and the brightness set to level 15 I managed to read 200 pages or around 6 hours without the battery case before getting a warning that only 10% battery was left. With the battery case attached I could easily have read two, maybe three books under the same conditions. The recently updated Kindle home screen now resembles a modern landing page, with your current book prominently featured along with reading lists and suggestions from Amazon and Goodreads. The touchscreen is also fast and responsive for an E-ink screen, making switching books or browsing for new ones easy. There’s a new quick settings panel from which you can enable aeroplane mode, sync the Kindle, adjust the backlight, view battery levels for the Oasis or the cover as well as access the rest of the settings menu. The basic Kindle reading experience is excellent with a choice of seven typefaces, including Amazon’s own Bookerly and Amazon Ember, which are specifically for screen reading. The font can be adjusted through eight sizes – from really quite small to very large – while line-spacing and margins can all be adjusted. In addition to simply showing you text, the Oasis is filled with great additions and helpful tools that aid the reading experience when needed, but get out the way when not. X-Ray, for instance, shows you extensive character and book information, while built in dictionary and Wikipedia access help readers understand what the author is trying to say with words they may not recognise, or translate them if they’re in another language. Simply holding your finger on a word invokes options to look up a meaning, highlight it, share it or add a note to it. Whole passages can be selected in a similar manner and shared to Twitter, Facebook, email or Amazon’s Goodreads book-based social network. Bookmarks help keep your place, while the Kindle will sync your reading progress so you can pick up where you left off on another device. You can also access Goodreads straight from the Kindle, view your friends’ books, reading progress, rate books and get recommendations, but only over Wi-Fi even if you have a 3G-capable Oasis, which is a bit strange. The Amazon Kindle Oasis comes in a choice of three cover colours costing £270 with Wi-Fi only or £330 with free global 3G, shipping on 27 April (buy here). For comparison, the Kindle Voyage costs £170 with Wi-Fi only (buy here), the Paperwhite costs £110 with Wi-Fi only and adverts (buy here), and the standard Kindle costs £60 with ads (buy here). Kobo’s Aura H2O costs £140 (buy here). The Amazon Kindle Oasis is the best e-reader available at the moment. Others may be waterproof, or have more advanced features, but the Oasis is just a nicer reading experience, from the way the software works to the way the device feels in your hand. But more than that the Kindle Oasis is a very nice thing. It’s a luxurious-feeling item that makes you want to hold it, to read it. Like a fine pen makes writing a more enjoyable act, the Oasis accentuates the reading experience. Is it a £100 better than the already expensive £170 Voyage or £160 better than the Paperwhite? No, it is basically the same experience minus the buttons and body. But is it worth the extra £100 as a luxury item, absolutely. Should you buy it? Probably not. It certainly isn’t for everyone, and the Paperwhite will likely be all the e-reader most will need, but Oasis is the one you’ll want. The Oasis is the Bentley to the Paperwhite’s Golf - both will get the job done, just one is a cut above the other. Pros: long battery life, light, easy to hold, excellent screen, even frontlight, great page-turn buttons, luxurious feel, large selection of ebooks Cons: expensive, front cover doesn’t protect back, not waterproof, Goodreads access requires Wi-Fi on 3G version Some Guardian articles and galleries contain links to various products and services.

More information on affiliate links', 'Civil society organizations and Peru government institutions say United Cacao is operating illegally, but the company denies it Two indigenous Shipibo men from Peru’s Amazon - Sedequías Ancón Chávez and Robert Guimaraes Vasquez - paid a rare visit to the London Stock Exchange (LSE) earlier this month. The reason? To present a letter addressed to Marcus Stuttard, Claire Dorrian and Umerah Akram from the LSE’s Alternative Investment Market (AIM) urging AIM to investigate, suspend and bar a company called United Cacao Limited SEZC - as well as amend its rules and “exact more active oversight” in general. “The nature of the crimes which the company stands accused are an important matter for AIM to address,” the letter states. “Allowing companies listed on AIM to raise capital to violate other countries’ national laws jeopardizes the “integrity and reputation” of the market, which is grounds for suspension of a company’s trading, according to AIM Rules.” The letter, accompanied by a 28-page report by the NGO Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) supported by almost 400 pages of annexes, states that AIM now has the opportunity to set an important example: The potential precedents set by AIM’s action on this case will have global relevance for stock exchanges, market actors, the global climate, and our planet’s population – including indigenous peoples and forest communities most directly affected by land and natural resource governance. . . Funds raised on international stock exchanges should not be available for companies operating in violation of the law, threatening the rights and resources of indigenous peoples, and causing serious environmental damage. The Guardian sought comment from United Cacao about the key accusations made against it and related companies - and it denies all of them. The first accusation is illegally deforesting at least 11,118 hectares of “mostly primary tropical rainforest.” United Cacao’s reply, sent through UK-based PR firm Tavistock Communications, is that it has only “3,787 hectares of agriculturally zoned, freehold land” and “there is clear and documented evidence of existing agricultural activities for each land parcel the Company owns.” Only 3,787 hectares? That doesn’t take into account United Cacao’s financial statements revealing that, by December 2014, it had provided more than US$3 million to two companies called Plantaciones de Pucallpa and Plantaciones de Ucayali - both of which are directly connected to United Cacao’s CEO Dennis Melka - which have deforested at least 9,174 hectares to cultivate oil palm. Land where agriculture already existed? Analysis of satellite images published in June 2015 by the Amazon Conservation Association and ACCA-Conservación Amazónica claimed that 98% of United Cacao’s project area near a town called Tamshiyacu was, before the company’s arrival in 2013, primary forest. “We confirm that the area cleared by United Cacao in 2013 was dominated by primary forest,” the NGOs stated. A similar conclusion was made by Greg Asner, from the US’s Carnegie Institution for Science, after using LIDAR technology to measure carbon stocks as part of a joint Carnegie-Ministry of Environment project. “The logical conclusion from the scientific data is that large-statured, intact forest was removed by this deforestation event [i.e. United Cacao’s plantation],” Asner told Mongabay in a January 2015 article. A second accusation is that United Cacao and related companies ignored three Peruvian government orders in December 2014 and September 2015 to cease operating at three plantations. United Cacao’s reply is that it “has only one plantation, not three”, and “has complied with all requests from the authorities and operates in full compliance with the law.” “Only one plantation”? Again, that doesn’t include the Plantaciones de Pucallpa and Plantaciones de Ucayali oil palm plantations. “Complied with all requests from the authorities”? In December 2014 United Cacao’s subsidiary Cacao del Peru Norte was ordered by the Office of Agrarian Environmental Affairs (DGAAA) within the Ministry of Agriculture (MINAGRI) to stop operating at Tamshiyacu, but analysis of satellite images published in March 2016 by the Amazon Conservation Association and ACCA-Conservación Amazónica claimed that deforestation not only continued in 2015 but actually increased. Furthermore, overflights of Tamshiyacu by Peruvian NGOs Sociedad Peruana de Ecodesarrollo and Kené in March 2015 and October 2015 both claimed to show the company was continuing to operate. It isn’t only civil society organisations arguing that United Cacao ignored the DGAAA’s order. In response to a company statement made on 5 May in immediate reply to the indigenous delegation’s trip to the LSE, Peru’s national forest authority, SERFOR, issued a searing condemnation yesterday of United Cacao and claimed that “multi-temporal analysis” of satellite images showed it had continued to deforest and thereby ignored the DGAAA’s request for the “temporary total paralysation of all its agricultural activities related to cultivating cacao.” The statement by SERFOR, also part of MINAGRI, claimed that Cacao del Peru Norte “has been trying to show internationally that it has observed the country’s laws” when “there are two national authorities, the DGAAA and SERFOR, which have argued the opposite.” It ended its statement by urging the LSE to “support the position of the Peruvian state expressed by the DGAAA and SERFOR, ensuring that the companies associated with it do what is required of them.” A third accusation is that United Cacao has made a series of “misrepresentations and material omissions” in public statements, including “claiming to have followed all environmental approval procedures when official documents demonstrate that this is not the case.” The company’s reply is that an Environmental Impact Assessment isn’t required for its Tamshiyacu plantation and that instead a Programa de Adecuación y Manejo Ambiental (PAMA) is the “agreed upon and authorised environmental certification”, that it is “in the process of submitting a completed PAMA”, that “final approval” is expected this year, and that the company “is allowed to work whilst the PAMA is progressed.” Is a PAMA really the “agreed upon and authorised environmental certification”? Not according to EIA’s report to the AIM, nor the DGAAA, nor Minister of Agriculture Juan Benites Ramos in a presentation to Peru’s Congress in October 2014. According to a November 2012 law, a PAMA can only apply to deforestation that took place before that law was passed, yet Cacao del Peru Norte began deforesting at Tamshiyacu in May 2013, according to its Admission Document to the AIM. Therefore, EIA asserts, what the company required was an Environmental Impact Assessment, not a PAMA, and it should have been approved before operations began. SERFOR asserts that United Cacao is violating Peruvian law on this issue too. Its recent statement argues that Cacao del Peru Norte - using capital letters at this point - “DOES NOT HAVE AN ENVIRONMENTAL CERTIFICATION APPROVED BY THE DGAAA” and “DOES NOT HAVE ANY PAMA NOR ANY OTHER TYPE OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT TOOL APPROVED.” It rejected, too, the company’s argument that having had the Terms of Reference for a PAMA approved means it can carry on operating. Indeed, EIA’s Rose Davis argues that, even if a PAMA was the “right environmental tool”, United Cacao still violated the law because it started operating before it had submitted the Terms of Reference for it, let alone had the Terms or the PAMA itself approved. She believes that the company effectively admitted this wrongdoing in its 5 May statement which, she says, shows “clear disregard for Peruvian law and misrepresents the legality of the company’s operations to investors.” “Melka claims that the PAMA is under evaluation, though we’ve seen no evidence that it was ever submitted,” Davis says. “But even if it was, it was too late for the over 1000 hectares of rainforest already lost.” Irrespective of whether the PAMA is the “right environmental tool”, or whether or not United Cacao’s handling of it already means it has violated the law, how seriously can we take the company’s interest in it anyway? It refused to tell the Guardian when the government requested it to present a PAMA, but it must have been before 10 September 2013, and yet now, almost mid-2016, the company still hasn’t done so. A fourth accusation - again related to “misrepresentations” and environmental procedures - is that United Cacao failed to obtain permission, at Tamshiyacu, to convert forest into land that can be used for agriculture, as is required by Peruvian law. The company’s reply is that “no permission was required given the land was transferred free of restrictions”, following a 1997 law, “and agricultural activities had previously been carried out on the land by the former owners resulting in there being no change of use in any case.” It argues that “the courts have ruled on this extensively in favour of the Company”, as have various state institutions. “No permission required”? According to EIA’s report to the AIM, United Cacao is relying on an outdated interpretation of the 1997 law that wasn’t issued by the right authority within MINAGRI, that failed to take into account Peru’s then current Forestry Law, and that was subsequently corrected by a DGAAA report in October 2014. That United Cacao needed to obtain permission for “land use change” was also argued by other MINAGRI reports that same year. “Though the matter has been clarified legally for over a year, United Cacao continues to argue that its subsidiary, Cacao del Peru Norte, did not require a land use change authorization to destroy the forest and replace it with a plantation,” EIA states. Again, SERFOR’s position is similar. Permission for “land use change” was needed by United Cacao, it argued in its recent statement, but the company never acquired it. “It should be noted that any company that has property title to land must first obtain an Environmental Certification (approved by the DGAAA) and then Change of Use Authorization (approved by the Regional Authority on Forests and Wildlife) in order to develop large-scale, agroindustrial activities,” SERFOR stated. What about United Cacao’s claim that there was “no change of use in any case”? As stated above, it is claimed that satellite images show the vast majority of the project area was primary forest before the company’s arrival. How does going from that and no doubt a few small-scale family agricultural plots to an industrial-sized cacao plantation not constitute a change of land use? A fifth accusation is that United Cacao’s operations and/or financing have violated indigenous peoples’ rights, including those enshrined in the International Labour Organization’s Convention 169, the jurisprudence of the Inter-American Court on Human Rights, and the UN’s Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The company’s reply is that “such claims are baseless. There are no indigenous communities anywhere near the Company’s estate.” But what about the Plantaciones de Pucallpa plantation? According to EIA’s report, that has deforested at least 500 hectares “in the area of the Native Community Santa Clara de Uchunya.” The letter to AIM was signed by 43 Peruvian organisations, 18 organisations from the EU and US and nine individuals, and argues that things could get much worse if the AIM doesn’t take rapid, meaningful action. According to the signatories, United Cacao, its subsidiaries and other Melka-associated companies have obtained or are trying to obtain “substantially more land” across Peru’s Amazon for large-scale plantations. “However, only a small percentage of land in the Amazon regions where these properties are located is suitable for agricultural purposes,” the letter reads. How much is “substantially more land”? A November 2015 report by the Ministry of Environment states that Melka-associated companies are eyeing up 66,000 hectares for oil palm: 20,000 hectares of “natural primary forests” in the River Maniti basin and approximately 46,000 hectares adjacent to the buffer zone of the Allpahuayo Mishana National Reserve and indigenous communities. An EIA report published in April 2015 put the number even higher: more than 96,000 hectares. The letter to AIM also mentions a recent “preliminary decision” by the Roundtable for Responsible Palm Oil (RSPO) on Plantaciones de Pucallpa, an RSPO member. The RSPO found that the company appears to have “cleared primary forest progressively since 2011” and “did not have the environmental permit as required by the Peruvian laws”, and ordered it to cease any “further land clearance and planting activities” until the complaint made against it is resolved. “The RSPO’s decision has nothing to do with United Cacao,” the company told the Guardian, despite its links to both Plantaciones de Pucallpa and Plantaciones de Ucayali. ‘[It] is cultivating cacao, not palm oil.” EIA’s Davis says that the connections between these companies is an issue their appeal to AIM is also intended to address. “[Those two companies] have received millions in financing from United Cacao in the form of related party transactions,” Davis says. “The potential reputational damage for AIM from the related companies’ illegal activities is thus based on the related party transaction financing link, the fact that Dennis Melka is the legal representative of all of these companies, and that the Ucayali region operations are referred to in Melka’s statements about his plantation experience to investors.” United Cacao plays down the connection between the companies. It acknowledged to the Guardian that there was a “short term loan”, but it “occurred prior to United Cacao “going public” and the holding company of [Plantaciones de Pucallpa and Plantaciones de Ucayali] fully repaid the loan prior to United Cacao joining AIM on 2 December 2014. Since then there has been no collaboration (financial or otherwise) between United Cacao and the other two private palm oil businesses.” The company denies it is violating AIM rules. “United Cacao complies fully with the AIM Rules and the regulators,” it told the Guardian. “Dennis Melka addressed this and other allegations in a recent interview.” According to the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) today, an 11 May letter from the LSE to EIA states that it is investigating United Cacao and that the allegations against the company have been referred to AIM Regulation. The WSJ article states that a United Cacao spokesman, after viewing the SERFOR statement, said that United Cacao hadn’t been contacted by SERFOR and the company “operates in full compliance with all applicable Peruvian and environmental law.” Disclaimer: One of the 70 signatories to the letter to the AIM was the NGO Global Witness, for which David Hill works as a consultant, but this article was written in Hill’s capacity as a Guardian environment writer.', 'Shake-up of broadcasting rules aims to bring digital on-demand services in-line with traditional TV broadcasters Netflix and Amazon’s European operations will have to guarantee to that at least 20% of video content in their catalogue is from Europe, according to a shake-up of broadcasting rules unveiled by the European Commission on Wednesday. European regulators are introducing the new rules to make the new wave of digital on-demand and streaming services adhere to the same, or similar, commitments that traditional TV broadcasters are forced to follow in Europe. “Currently, European TV broadcasters invest around 20% of their revenues in original content and on-demand providers less than 1%,” said the European Commission. “The Commission wants TV broadcasters to continue to dedicate at least half of viewing time to European works and will oblige on-demand providers to ensure that at least 20% share of European content in their catalogues.” In addition, platforms such as Netflix and Amazon will have to ensure that their services provide “good visibility” and prominence to European content in their digital catalogues. The Commission’s proposal also said member states have the option to make on-demand services “contribute financially” to making new European films and TV series. This can be through direct investment in European TV and film productions, such as Amazon’s investment in ex-Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson’s new TV series, or as a levy payable into a fund. Netflix recently premiered its first French language series, the political drama Marseilles starring Gérard Depardieu, and British period drama The Crown, which will launch later this year. “Overall, strengthening the promotion of European works for on-demand services will lead to a broader and more diverse offer for Europeans,” the Commission said. “This will have a positive impact on cultural diversity and bring more opportunities for European creators.” Netflix disagreed with the Commission’s ruling, arguing that a quota system, as well as forced investment in European productions, will not necessarily lead to quality shows being made. Instead, it could lead to operators buying, or investing in, cheap productions and “filler” content to hit quotas. “Our members around the world love European programming, that’s why our investment in European programming, including Netflix original titles created in Europe, is growing,” said a spokesman for Netflix. “We appreciate the Commission’s objective to have European production flourish, however the proposed measures won’t actually achieve that.”  Netflix said it has committed “hundreds of millions” of euros to European productions so far, as well as having partnerships with broadcasters including the BBC, for Watership Down, and ITV for Marcella, which stars Anna Friel. According to a study provided by the European Commission, Netflix and Apple’s iTunes already devote 21% of their film catalogue to content from the European Union. The European Commission’s new rules also state that services such as YouTube will have to beef up protections for younger users being exposed to harmful content such as videos with pornographic or violent content, and “protect all citizens from incitement to hatred”. “Detailed measures include tools for users to report and flag harmful content, age verification, or parental control systems,” said the Commission. The European Commission said it is weeks away from presenting the results of a code of conduct on combatting hate speech online that it has been working on with major online platforms. “The way we watch TV or videos may have changed, but our values don’t,” said Günther Oettinger, commissioner for the digital economy and society. “With these new rules we will uphold media pluralism, the independence of audiovisual regulators and will make sure incitement to hatred will have no room on video-sharing platforms. We also want to ensure a level-playing field, responsible behaviour, trust and fairness in the online platforms environment.”', 'Storing voice recordings of people younger than 13 via Alexa, Google Home and Siri appears to flout the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act In a promotional video for Amazon’s Echo virtual assistant device, a young girl no older than 12 asks excitedly: “Is it for me?”. The voice-controlled speaker can search the web for information, answer questions and even tell kids’ jokes. “It’s for everyone,” enthuses her on-screen dad. Except that it isn’t. An investigation by the Guardian has found that despite Amazon marketing the Echo to families with young children, the device is likely to contravene the US Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), set up to regulate the collection and use of personal information from anyone younger than 13. Along with Google, Apple and others promoting voice-activated artificial intelligence systems to young children, the company could now face multimillion-dollar fines. “This is part of the initial wave of marketing to children using the internet of things,” says Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a privacy advocacy group that helped write the law. “It is exactly why the law was enacted in the first place, to protect young people from pervasive data collection.” Google’s standalone Home device, announced on 18 May but not yet on sale, also targets children. A promotional video shown at the company’s I/O event has a young boy talking to the Home, while his sister uses it to get help with her schoolwork. Apple’s Siri, found on iPhones and iPads, probably also violates COPPA. One advert for the virtual assistant includes a young girl talking to Siri, while its latest commercial features Cookie Monster from Sesame Street. The company is also rumoured to be working on a standalone voice-controlled device. COPPA applies to online services that are either designed for children younger than 13 or that know those children are using them. It also singles out the use of celebrities, like Cookie Monster, who appeal to children. Khaliah Barnes, associate director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), believes that by showing pre-teenage children using voice-activated AI devices, Amazon, Google and Apple are admitting their services are aimed at youngsters. “When your advertising markets this product to children, and parents with children, that would absolutely trigger COPPA,” she says. “Recording children in the privacy of the home is genuinely creepy, and this warrants additional investigation by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and [US] states.” Jeff Chester agrees. “Online devices have replaced TV as the babysitter, and companies will know there’s a child there by the very nature of the interaction,” he says. Amazon and Google told the Guardian that they comply with COPPA, while an Apple spokesperson said it complied and doesn’t target kids. All have extensive privacy policies. However, COPPA forbids a company from storing a child’s personal information, including recordings of their voice, without the explicit, verifiable consent of their parents. The law specifies the ways a company can get that consent, such as a signed letter, video chat or phone call. Although all three companies store audio files of voice requests in the cloud, none of them use a COPPA-approved method to seek consent beforehand. One way to comply is to limit services to users older than 13. Microsoft, for instance, does not allow users whose age in their online profile is 12 or younger to access its Cortana virtual assistant on Windows computers, phones or tablets. On the company’s Xbox One console, younger users must get a parent to make a small (50 cent) purchase on a credit card to activate voice and video services – a method also approved by COPPA. Another way is not to store voice recordings from children at all, although this can make the AI service less effective. Martin Reddy is chief technical officer at ToyTalk, developer of the Hello Barbie doll that can hold a conversation with young children. The toy uses a built-in microphone to send a child’s voice up to a speech recognition engine in the cloud. “In a perfect world, you’re done at that point and you can drop the audio data on the floor,” Reddy says. “But we’re storing it because it’s not a perfect world. We’re using it to build better models so kids can get a better experience.” Reddy claims that analysing the recordings enables ToyTalk to boost the accuracy of what Hello Barbie hears by about 15%. ToyTalk uses an email process to ensure that parents know what is going on, a method allowed by COPPA in some situations. Parents can also log in to a website to review or delete audio. “We have contracts and written assurances that [our voice recognition service provider] complies with COPPA and they drop the data on the floor as soon as they finish making the transcription,” Reddy says. The penalties for violating COPPA can be heavy – up to $16,000 for every violation. In 2014, online review site Yelp paid $450,000 after admitting that it had collected children’s personal information without notifying parents and obtaining consent. And in December of 2015, two software developers paid $300,000 after allowing third-party advertisers to collect children’s personal information through their mobile apps. The FTC, which handles infractions of COPPA, notes that financial penalties can depend on the number of children and the size of the company involved. Amazon has sold an estimated 3m Echo devices in the US, and Apple more than 100m iPhones – which could mean massive fines if the FTC decides to prosecute. Jeff Chester of the Center for Digital Democracy believes that large fines would be unlikely, at least initially. “This is such a new area that it’s important to give industry guidance,” he says, “We’re going to recommend to the FTC that they give industry guidance of how the internet of things and COPPA should work together.” However, Khaliah Barnes notes that even enforcing COPPA properly would not solve all the problems raised by virtual assistants. “Parents cannot reasonably review all the information that these ‘always on’ devices are collecting from children,” she says. “Then what about data security, hacking or when you walk into a home and you’re not aware there’s a recording device there? “Do we want to live in a society that conditions children to constant surveillance?”']\n"
